# Korean Adoptee (KAD) Library

There are innumerable resources available to help KADs build community, travel to Korea, engage with multimedia, and more. As a Korean Adoptee overwhelmed by the sheer volume of information available in disparate locations, I built this personal project to serve as a resource library for Korean adoptees - once signed up, users can submit, review, and bookmark resources to curate a personal list of favorite resources. Forum functionality coming soon.

The application is built on Ruby on Rails and is deployed on Heroku; the site uses HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap for the front-end. The application features polymorphic database associations to allow users to favorite resources and, eventually, forum posts and other user profiles.

## Features

* Resources organized by category

* Community-driven resource creation, including links to websites, locations (if applicable), and descriptions

* Bookmarks for resources allow users to curate a list of personal favorites

* Reviews for resources include a star rating using Font Awesome icons
